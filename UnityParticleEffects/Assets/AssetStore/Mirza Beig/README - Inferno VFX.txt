NOTES:

This is a free asset.

It's free because it was created to test out my Shuriken -> Spritesheet conversion tool 
and is based off my other product, VFX "Ultimate" Particle Pack - a unique, all-in-one solution for particles!

Nevertheless, these two are completely DIFFERENT assets! Enjoy!!

Please check it out the latter on the asset store.

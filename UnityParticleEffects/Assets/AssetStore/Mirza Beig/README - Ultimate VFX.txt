- Some more prefabs.

v2.6.2:

- Total of 300+ prefabs.
- Updated distortion shaders.

- Updated and added new trail textures.
- Updated snow sheet textures.

- Updated Particle Scaler for 5.5. New features!

v2.5.1 (unreleased):

- Several new prefabs added to the XP Titles expansion pack.
- Some bug fixes with GLOBAL force affectors. Local force affectors are unaffected.

- Note that the new particle forces components in Ultimate VFX are NOT the same as the new modules in Unity 5.5. 
---
-- These will not be removed or deprecated since they offer new functionality that Unity/Shuriken doesn't have natively.

- The included Particle Lights component will be removed when Unity 5.5 is fully released (not beta!) since Shuriken will support particle lights natively in that version and onwards.

v2.5.0:

- Updated particle force manipulators for optimization.
...
-- Now featuring attraction, vortex, and turbulence!
-- Experimental GPU-powered variants added. 

- More prefabs - mostly showing off the new force affectors.

v2.2.0:

- Added several material variations for quick fx building.
- And of course... more prefabs! Keep those suggestions going.

- Preparing release for new FREE expansion, "Titles XP".
...
-- Great for full-screen game menu, credits, title screens, etc.

- Preparing release for new FREE expansion, "Shockwave XP".
...
-- Great for epic sci-fi impacts.

- Some of the newer prefabs use Particle Playground. 
...
-- They can be used as-is, but can only be *fully* tweaked 
   if you have Particle Playground imported into your project.
   
-- These prefabs are marked by starting with the "pp-" prefix.
-- This is an experimental add-on, so only a few of the effects use PP.

- Added some experimental force manipulators for attraction and vortices.
...
-- These are not yet optimized, but still fun to play with.

- Added some much needed documentation under _DOCS.
